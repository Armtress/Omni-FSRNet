# Omni-FSRNet Reproduction Code

This repository is dedicated to hosting the official reproduction code for the paper:  
**"Omni-FSRNet: Omni-direction Feature Search and Refinement Network for BRAFV600E Mutation Prediction in Thyroid Ultrasound"**


## Status Update
The code for this project is currently in preparation and **coming soon**. We will release the complete implementation, including model definitions, training/inference scripts, and auxiliary functional modules (e.g., data preprocessing, evaluation metrics) as soon as it is finalized.


## Notes on Dataset
To strictly adhere to medical research ethics and protect patient privacy, the clinical thyroid ultrasound dataset used in the original study cannot be made publicly available. This aligns with institutional review board (IRB) regulations and industry standards for safeguarding sensitive patient information.  

For researchers intending to validate or extend the model, we recommend using qualified thyroid ultrasound datasets that comply with local ethical guidelines and data usage protocols.


## Stay Tuned
We will update this repository promptly once the code is ready. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to open an issue.
